**Retail Shop Database Project**

**Project Overview**
This project is dedicated to designing and managing a comprehensive database system for a retail shop. The main objectives include creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to outline the data structure, implementing the database tables based on the ER diagram, and inserting sample data for testing and demonstration purposes. Additionally, six queries have been developed to support key shop operations and enhance data retrieval, contributing to improved efficiency and informed decision-making.
